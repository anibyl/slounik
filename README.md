# Slounik

**Slounik** is an Android client application for Belarusian dictionary websites published on
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anibyl.slounik).

Currently, it supports dictionaries from following websites:
* slounik.org (Электронная энцыкляпэдыя),
* skarnik.by (Скарнік),
* rv-blr.com (Родныя вобразы),
* verbum.by (Verbum).

Also, it has a built-in English-Belarusian dictionary. It's disabled at the moment and will be removed from the project
eventually after integration with Verbum.
